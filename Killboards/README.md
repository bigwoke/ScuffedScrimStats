This directory must contain two subdirectories, which themselves contain the killboards for their respective participating scrim team. The name of each subdirectory is the name or tag of the team displayed in the script's output.

These killboards are just saved whole webpages from fisu: https://ps2.fisu.pw/killboard/

If there are not exactly two folders in this directory, the script will not run.
